                Amazon focuses on online advertising, cloud computing, e-commerce and artificial intelligence. This is most usable website by the 
                multiple users, so I redesign the some main screens of website as well as application of amazon to make it more convenient for the users.
                I make the changes in the UI and only few changes in UX for the better experience and interaction of the customers.  <br><br>
            </p>

                What changes I made in UX  <br><br>
            </p>  
            <p class="project21"> 
                In UX, In mobile version, I change the header and footer UX design.
                I move the hamburger menu from footer to header because It is
                experienced great by user in the header. I also give the logo in mobile version in header right side.
                I move the location from top of body to footer as icon. Because it is invisible on the screen and  it can be
                properly used in the footer as it is properly visible. <br><br>
                In the desktop version, I changed the header and footer only, in the header I move the location from left to right,
                because it is not looks nice with the logo, it should be a in the right side with other icons so it can be properly
                used and then it makes layout nicely of the header bar. <br><br>
                I move the links from left side to right on the navigation bar, because there is alsoa hamburger menu
                and it is experienced and looks good on right side of screen. All other links are also make the header layout
                nice below the other icons rather some links or icon on the right side some are on the left side.
                In the footer, I move the back to top button below the
                descriptions, because its position above it looks like hoch poch.<br><br>

                In UI, I changed the color of header from sea green to dark blue because it looks nice with white search bar and
                white menu icon.
                I changed the color of under header bar from same sea green to light color. It differentiate the search
                header and links header bars, now it is more visible and looks nice. 
                I also change the typography to Open sans and color of cards like background color to light sky blue. I give
                the red color to stars and buttons with white text so that buttons are highlighted and looks bold.<br><br>
                I give the footer border to the cards with dark blue color and white text to make a good contrast
                I also give the boder to footer same as header and change the icons color to white for more visibility
                on border. In desktop version, I also give the footer border to the deals and red color to the discount value with
                white background for the customer attraction. I give the black border to browser history data text
                and red colors to rates and price, also red color to button. I give the light peach color to the bottom part of 
                screen with white text.
