                Mobile bandit is a free application with free multiple deals. I make the changes in the UX part of this 
                application to the better and easy usable experience of the user. <br><br>

                Notes <br><br>In existing application, on  home page, there is hamburger and logo are together that are hard to identify and does'nt look 
                nice. I give the proper alignment both of these according to their preference.
                Search is also very light in appearance , I changed it below the menu bar by giving 
                a background so it is easy to navigate by user.

                I give the pplication name in proper alignment and in one row it looks professional.

                In existing app there is no any footer bar, I add a footer bar because user can easily go through these 
                three features.

                        I show only the mixed or all feature list on home page which is main purpose of this app.
                        In existing app in hamburger there are again feature link, active link etc.
        
                        But I changed it by put the  main features of app in hamburger like Home, nearest, newest, top deals.
        
                        These all are linked together and from each page user can go to home page and these features page easily.<br><br>

                        In existing app on page of categories, five options are there which are shown by images and category name is written on
                every image whcih is less visual appear but I modify it by showig in two columns category name & image.

                        When page opens then it does’nt show the name of page so I put it below the search bar.
                        When page opens then it does’nt show the name of page so I put it below the search bar. <br><br>
                        In existing app on search page there is no logo, app name, hamburger to go back to any page, just a cross to close the page,
                        I add header bar so it can be shown that what app is and there are recent searches which are linkable but user cannot identify
                        unless they will click on it, so I show search history as it goes to particular page.

                        In Nearest, Newest, Top Deals pages info is shown in existing app like the screen shot but I make the changes in proposed app pages by give the information in on
                        left side and image on right side. Now user can better experienced it. I also add footer on these pages.
