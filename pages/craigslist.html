            <p class="project21"> 
                Craigslist is an advertising website and application which provides the help to finding the jobs, housing, community services 
                gigs etc. I redesign some pages of website as well as application for UX and UI both to give it a better look and the user 
                can use it easily. <br><br>
            </p>
            <p class="project2">
                What changes I made in UX <br><br>
                
            </p>  
            <p class="project21"> 
                Mobile version: <br>I move the account/profile from footer to header bar at the right side of logo.
                
                I move the location from top below the header bar, at the left of search bar, which makes it properly aligned.
                
                I make the categories into a card and my searches into different card which shows by scrolling the screen.
                
                I add the home into footer bar so user can directly go to home from any page and I keep the favorite, post and feedback into the footer also.<br><br>
                
                Website version: <br> I make the proper header navigation bar which shows logo, account, city which is selected by user and all cities link, now it is easy to understand and use by users.
                
                I move the language selection text box from right to left and search bar leftto right because these are not visible properly and not aligned well before.
                
                I make the post card on home page which shows after clicking on the link on other page.
                
                I move the nearby location links under the post to utilized the page properly and to show the user nicely.
                
                I move all the footer links and right side bar links into footer bar, because there is very hoch poch in the home page with multiple links, now these are all in one side.<br><br>
                Mobile version: <br>I aligned the location, category, search
                and hamburger menu under header section.
                
                I give the proper background to the description above the picture of the particular search.<br><br>
                
                Website version: <br>I make the header with post and account, search and logo nicely.
                
                I aligned the search results under header with drop down icon so user can search for something else from
                here.
                
                I also give the background card to the posts, which shows to scrolling the screen.<br><br>
                Mobile version: <br>I add the header bar into this screen also, so that each screen of app looks consistant.

                I move the reply button, favorite and delete icon from below the screen to under the image of post.<br><br>

                Website version: <br>I also add the header in the desktop version and give the nice layout to the search result bars like city then it shows search category then further category.

                I move the favorite and all icons from left to right side of screen which are not visible for the user before and reply button is on left side as it is in existing design.<br><br>
                Mobile version: <br>I add the image before the description of the post searched by user under Jobs and I also display the favorite and hide icon on the right side of description, which are shown by sliding the post to left in existing design, so user can’t find it easily until they slide the post.<br><br>


                Website version: <br>I display the header properly also in this screen which search and icons, logo and searching results description.

                I also show the drop-down for selection with icons and side by side.

                I change the layout of post by giving the icons under post headline.<br><br>
                Mobile version:<br> I add the header in save search screen which is not display in existing app.

                I also display the Preview and Save button togather, in existing app Save button is in the footer and Preview button is in the middle of screen which does’nt look nice.

                I also give the footer to this screen for the user’s easy experience.<br><br>


                Website version:<br> I give the proper cards, borders and layout to the About screen, which is very important screen, which shows lot of links for the user.

                I give the bondi blue color to the header and bondi blue linear color to the footer of each screen in Mobile as well as Desktop version which make the consistancy in each screen of app or website. 

                I make the icons and links color of header white and color of footer typography or icons is black. In existing app there is no color of these sections which looks dull.

                I also give the orange color to the header and footer of the cards and posts which highlights the name or description for the easily understanable by user and easy visibility.
                <br><br>
                I make the icons black in mobile footer but on which page the user experience then black stroke circle will display around that icon.


                I make the text boxes white but I give the stroke kind of orange color to make it attractive. I also give the same color stroke to the check boxes.

                I change the color of buttons to bondi blue color with white text which shows the good combination between each other.

                <br><br>               I change the typography to Montserrat which is easily readable by any person like youngsters and elders because this app/website will be used by different kind of people.

                Headings are bold and semi-bold but the body text and links, icons text is in regular and medium font weight.

                I change the mostly all icons style, I choose an attractive style of icons.
